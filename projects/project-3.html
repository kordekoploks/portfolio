            <li> The Active Sleep Bed Remote App is a simple yet effective solution for controlling various bed positions.</li>
<li>As the Flutter Developer for the Active Sleep Monitoring app, my role is central to implementing best practices while ensuring the app delivers accurate, real-time insights into bed positioning and sleep quality. I’m responsible for several critical aspects of the project:

    App Architecture: I’ve designed the app using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to ensure a clean separation between the app’s business logic and user interface. This structure supports efficient data handling and a smooth user experience, making it easier to maintain and scale the app.

    State Management: With BLoC, I ensure the app efficiently manages real-time data for bed positioning and sleep quality metrics, providing users with seamless updates and remote control functionality for bed adjustments.

    Clean Code Practices: By adhering to clean code principles, I ensure that the codebase is modular, reusable, and easy to understand. I follow SOLID principles to maintain flexibility and scalability in the app as new features are added.

    IoT Device Integration: I’ve implemented an IoT device to control and monitor bed positioning remotely. This device gathers data on sleep quality metrics, such as movement during sleep, and sends it to the app. Users can remotely adjust bed positions to enhance comfort and sleep quality, all while receiving real-time feedback.

    Firebase Integration: By using Firebase as the backend, I manage data in real time, ensuring that users can monitor their sleep quality, adjust bed positioning, and receive notifications instantly, even from remote locations.

    Through my implementation of best practices and cutting-edge technology, I ensure that the Active Sleep Monitoring app is highly functional, reliable, and built for future growth.</li>
